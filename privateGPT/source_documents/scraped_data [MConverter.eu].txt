Abstract Book of ICI Meeting (Technology Parade), 5thDecember 2011, Israel.Parikh K, Chag MC et al. \u2013 The ORBIT I trial evaluated the safety and performance of an orbital atherectomy system (OAS) for the treatment of de novo calcified coronary lesions. The ORBIT I trial suggests that the OAS may offer an effective method to change compliance of calcified coronary lesions to facilitate optimal stent placement in these difficult to treat patients. A larger trial is required to establish safety and overall effectiveness of the OAS in treating calcified coronary lesions.
